REDIS PUBSUB VS RABBITMQ -->
Redis works better in enterprise applications that require real-time data processing and
low-latency caching. With its in-memory data store and support for diverse data structures,
Redis is suitable for performing low-level data computation. For example,
financial institutions use Redis to cache transactional data to enable real-time fraud detection.

Meanwhile, choose RabbitMQ if you need a dedicated microservices message broker with
asynchronous communication mechanisms to support code and system building.
RabbitMQ is also more suitable than Redis for transferring large files between applications.
For example, a system that needs to send data reliably between many microservices might choose RabbitMQ.
The system will benefit from RabbitMQ’s fault tolerance, larger file handling capacity,
and guaranteed message delivery mechanisms.

PUBSUB
once the consumer connection is closed, the queue should be deleted. There's an exclusive flag for that:
result = channel.queue_declare(queue='', exclusive=True)
